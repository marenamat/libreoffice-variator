# Document Variator Libreoffice Extension

Mark pieces of the document by bookmarks "Variant (number)(letter)" and click
the icon. The extension creates all variants of the document where for each
number is one letter chosen.

Example: With bookmarks "Variant 1A", "Variant 1B", "Variant 1C", "Variant 2A"
and "Variant 2B", variants AA, AB, BA, BB, CA, CB are created.

The filepicker expects you to specify the stem, e.g. by specifying "foo.pdf" as
the output file, you get "foo-AA.pdf", "foo-AB.pdf" etc.

Tables and Frames are broken and not easily fixable.

Images behave weirdly.

This is possibly a very unstable extension, use with care and always save your
files before using.
